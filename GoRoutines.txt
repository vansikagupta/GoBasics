* just write "go" in front of any function to make it a concurrent go routine.
* go routines are non blocking and are processed concurrently.
* in order to make sure all go routines have been executed before exiting the program, we synchronise them using "sync" package

* For example we can use  sync.WaitGroup, everytime we call a go routine, we do wg.Add(1)
and then we wait with wg.Wait() until that routine is done executing
* From within the function we do wg.Done() to notify that it is done executing.

*** We should defer wg.Done() so that in case of error we don't end up waiting forever
