* Describe and Context are containers that are used to organise the specs
* 'It' is the test spec
* BeforeEach and AfterEach to build up or tear down common set-ups for test.
# Always initialize your variables in BeforeEach blocks.

## Example 
func TestAdd(t *testing.T){
	ans := Add(1, 2)
	if ans!= 3 {
		t.Errorf("Result for input: %d, %d | want: %d", 1, 2, 3)
	}
}
** both are similar
It("can add two positive numbers", func(){
		ans := Add(4,18)

		Expect(ans).To(Equal(22))
	})

** Specify can be used instead of It
** To remove duplication and use common setup across tests, BeforeEach blocks are used.
** Use Describe to describe individual behaviours.
** Use Context to exercise those behaviours under different circumstances.
